### Project Statement

The purpose of this activity is the implementation of the front-end stages of the design of a programming language, that is, the first stages of building a specific language compiler.

You will build the front end of a simplified language here called AlgZinh (which is a simple notation for describing algorithms) and which will be described in the sequence of this text.

The implementation of your compiler must be done in C language (ANSI standard - described in book C: Programming Language authored by Kernighan and Ritchie, 2nd edition) for the compiler implementation. Your program will be tested on Dev-C ++ in the Windows environment. Any problems with the execution of your program in this environment will result in discounts on the grade awarded. The use of any external library that is not available in the basic installation of DEV C ++ in the Windows environment is not allowed.

The project is divided into 4 stages corresponding to 4 deliveries made during the semester: 
(1) Finite automaton
(2) Lexical analyzer
(3) Syntactic analyzer
(4) Semantic analyzer
