# Compiler
Creating a compiler: lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis


### Project Statement

The purpose of this activity is the implementation of the front-end stages of the design of a programming language, that is, the first stages of building a specific language compiler. You will build the front end of a simplified language here called AlgZinh (which is a simple notation for describing algorithms) and which will be described in the sequence of this text. The implementation of your compiler must be done in C language (ANSI standard) for the compiler implementation.

The project is divided into 4 stages corresponding to 4 deliveries made during the semester: 
(1) Finite automaton
(2) Lexical analyzer
(3) Syntactic analyzer
(4) Semantic analyzer
